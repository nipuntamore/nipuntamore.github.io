            <h2>गनिमी कावा the gurriella warfare</h2>
            <p>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj pioneered a form of warfare known as Ganimi Kava. This was born out of necessity, as his small army was often vastly outnumbered by the massive, slow-moving forces of the Mughals and the Adilshahi Sultanate.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Surprise and Speed: Instead of open-field battles, Maratha forces used lightning-fast strikes. They would emerge from the dense forests of the Sahyadris, attack the enemy's supply lines, and vanish back into the mountains before the enemy could regroup.</li>

                    <li>Terrain Advantage: He utilized the narrow mountain passes (Ghats) where large enemy cavalry and cannons became a liability. In these narrow spaces, a few hundred Maratha soldiers could hold off thousands of invaders.</li>

                    <li>Psychological Warfare: By attacking at night and using the "hit and run" method, he kept the enemy in a constant state of fear and exhaustion.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>शिलेदार of Swarajya</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Sovereignty is the Fort: Shivaji Maharaj famously believed, "ज्यापाशी किल्ला, त्याचे राज्य" (He who owns the forts, owns the kingdom). To him, a fort wasn't just stone and mortar; it was the very breath of Swarajya.</li>

                <li>The Sahyadri Shield: The rugged peaks of the Sahyadri were natural skyscrapers. Maharaj transformed these peaks into Killas (forts) that acted as watchful eyes over the Maval region.</li>

                <li>Aatmarakshana (Self-Defense): When the enemy attacked with thousands of soldiers, our forts acted as a Lok-Aasra (shelter for the people). Even a small garrison of Mavals could hold off a massive Mughal army from the heights of a Buruj (Bastion).</li>

                <li>Jal-Durg (Sea Forts): Recognizing that "He who has the navy, owns the sea," Maharaj built sea-forts like Sindhudurg to guard the Konkan coast against the Siddhis and the British.</li>
